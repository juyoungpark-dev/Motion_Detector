# Project : Motion Detector
## Day7 of #100DaysOfCode
Simple motion detector in Python + OpenCV

#### Goal: to learn where python can be used & learn openCV
#### Start Time: 3pm
#### End Time: 5pm
#### Hours: 2

## What I have learned today
* OpenCV: open-source library for the "Computer Vision"
  > used for machine learning, image processing              
  > it can process images, videos to identify objects                   
  > usages: face/object recognition; surveillance;count #of people or vehicles along with speed; etc;         
* things to remember about OpenCV:     
  > pip install opencv-python           
  > if you run the py program, camera will be operated              
  > press 'q' to quit the program
